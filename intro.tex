\section{Introduction}

Relational data are widespread in modern sciences. From social networks to protein interaction, from physics to linguistics, all interacting objects can be represented as a graph where the objects are the nodes and the interaction the edges. Modelization of such graphs are an important interest in the machine learning literature for prediction tasks as well as dimensionality reduction. One of the main challenge in this area is to be able to scale to massive networks, as the one currently available from the current state of the internet. The complexity (time and memory) of batch algorithm are polynomial for graph. Thus, the need of online algorithm, able to update a model as data become available is fundamental for scaling strategy. This can because of the temporality of the data or more simply because the data don't fit in memory. Another source of diversity in networks is the support for labelled and dynamic networks. In this paper we study and propose an algorithm based on latent models with rich priors who scale for complex and massive networks, with labeled edges (weighted networks), and that can be adapted to model the exchangeability of sequences of binary networks (temporal networks).
