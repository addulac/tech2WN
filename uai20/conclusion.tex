\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We studied in this paper the problem of modeling weighted networks through generalized stochastic block models. The stochastic block models proposed so far for weighted networks suffer from the same drawback as standard stochastic block models, namely the fact that a node can belong to only one class, which is not realistic for many networks and can be corrected by using mixed-membership block models. We have thus developed new mixed-membership stochastic block models to model (directed or undirected) weighted networks and have proposed a scalable inference method, based on a combination of collapsed and stochastic variational inference. This allowed us to deploy the new models on large networks comprising millions of edges. Experiments conducted on nine real-world networks of different types and sizes showed that the new models outperform previously proposed models on the weight prediction task, with reasonable inference time.

In the future, we want to develop versions of these models with different kernels so as to model signed networks and be able to generate different types of weights, thus extending the set of tools available for network analysis.
