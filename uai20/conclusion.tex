\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We proposed in this paper a new model, from the mixed-membership stochastic block model family, to deal with (directed or undirected) weighted networks. We furthermore showed that this model can be efficiently learned through a stochastic collapsed variational approach that couples collapsed variational and stochastic inference, so that the model can be deployed on networks comprising millions of edges. Experiments conducted on several networks showed that the proposed model can successfully predict the weights of the links  in various real world networks and that it outperforms the state of the art models. 
%Another interesting property of this model is the fact that it outperforms other stochastic block models when the mount of training data is limited.
