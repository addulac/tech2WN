\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We proposed a new model that extend the MMSB model to acount for weights in networks. We derived an efficent online inference algorithm using Stochastic Collapsed Variationnal approach able to scale to large networks. We show empiracally that our model can succesfully recover the topology of various real world networks and that it outperforms MMSB and the non-augmented weighted version of the model, in the same inference settings. Moreover, we show that the model is efficient when only a  small portion of the networks is observed and that it stay competitive with modern efficient Stochastic block models implementation.
