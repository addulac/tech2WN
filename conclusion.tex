\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We proposed a new model that extend the MMSB model to account for weights in networks. We derived an efficient online inference algorithm using Stochastic Collapsed Variationnal approach able to handle very  large size networks. We show empirically that our model can successfully model the topology of various real world networks and that it outperforms MMSB and the non-augmented weighted version of the model, with the same inference settings. Moreover, we show that the model is efficient when only a  small portion of the networks is observed and that it stay competitive with modern efficient Stochastic block models implementation.
